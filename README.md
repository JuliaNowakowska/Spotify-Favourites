# Spotify Favourites

This is a Python-based application that integrates with the **Spotify Web API** and **Genius API** to retrieve a user's top tracks, fetch corresponding lyrics, and store this information in a local database. Once the lyrics are stored, an **emotion classification model** is used in order to investigate which emotions dominate in the user's favourite tracks from Spotify.
